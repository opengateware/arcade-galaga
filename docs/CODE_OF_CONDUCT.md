# Code Of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and leaders pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level or type of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
Note, however, that religion, political party, or other ideological affiliation provide no exemptions for the behavior we outline as unacceptable in this Code of Conduct.

## Our Standards

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Be kind and courteous to others
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Collaborating with other community members
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances
- The use of inappropriate images, including in a community member's avatar
- The use of inappropriate language, including in a community member's nickname
- Any spamming, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior
- Excessive or unwelcome helping; answering outside the scope of the question asked
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

The goal of the standards and moderation guidelines outlined here is to build and maintain a respectful community. We ask that you don’t just aim to be "technically unimpeachable", but rather try to be your best self.

We value many things beyond technical expertise, including collaboration and supporting others within our community. Providing a positive experience for other community members can have a much more significant impact than simply providing the correct answer.

## Our Responsibilities

Project leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project leaders respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, metadata, artwork, manuals, videos, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities. But also have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject messages, comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any community member for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct and the enforcement policies listed above apply to all Rætro Community venues. This includes but is not limited to any community spaces (both public and private), the entire Rætro Discord server, and all Rætro associated GitHub repositories. Examples of Rætro Community spaces include but are not limited to meet-ups, audio chats on the Rætro Discord, or interaction at a conference.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. As a community member, you are representing our community, and are expected to behave accordingly.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at or contact [community@raetro.org][conduct-email].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
